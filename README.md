# AVPTag 
(created by [Hopefullty](youtube.com/@hopefullty) on YouTube.)

AVPTag is a way to run Gorilla Tag on a Apple Vision Pro. Here is how.

1.  Every time a Gorilla Tag Steam VR (PC-VR) update comes out, our app will detect that.
    
2.  When an update is released, your Windows device will be asked to update it on Steam.
    
3.  Your MacOS will release the update to your Vision Pro, like a middleman.

4.  Your Vision Pro will install the update with the AVPTag app.

5.  Enjoy AVPTag!
