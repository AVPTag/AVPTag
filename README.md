**AVPTag** (created by [Hopefullty](youtube.com/@hopefullty) on YouTube.)

AVPTag is a way to run Gorilla Tag on a Apple Vision Pro. Here is how.

1.  Every time a Gorilla Tag Steam VR (PC-VR) update comes out, our app will detect that.
    
2.  When there is an update, your Apple Vision Pro will connect wirelessly to the macOS app "AVPTag" and will open on your mac. This will install the latest Gorilla Tag.exe and its files to ~/AVPTag/GorillaTag/
    
3.  A wine application will be installed to open Gorilla Tag.exe and its files. It is created by AVPTag.
    
4.  This application will run in the background while you play Gorilla Tag, so your mac can still be used while used.
    
5.  To run these wirelessly without your mac running the app in the background, you need to sideload AVPTag.ipa. However, you must use a mac once to sideload this application.
    
6.  You may log into your Steam account only as of now to get your cosmetics. We will push out Meta soon.

Things to know:

 1. Fast Performance
We have created our own version of wine to ensure performance is at the maximum, without breaking the system.
 2. Hand Tracking
Of course, we want to come up with something new. Something without controllers, so you don't need any controllers, including Nintendo Switch, Oculus, etc. to run Gorilla Tag. With this hand tracking, your ring and pinky finger on both hands will be ignored since the "monkes" only have 3 fingers per hand.
 3. Uses official Steam authentication
When you get AVPTag, you will be prompted to download the latest depot of Gorilla Tag from Steam. This is the start of your journey.
 4. 100% safe (as long as you get it from the right sources)
We created AVPTag knowing anything can happen, like people making "pirated", or illegal copies of Gorilla Tag with this. We forced it so you must have Gorilla Tag.exe and a Steam account with Gorilla Tag. This is the only official way to launch AVPTag. Any other way is NOT us.
 5. Legal Use
We created AVPTag with legal precautions. Our first idea was not legal, so we changed it to the PCVR method. This ENSURES any legal issues are not our fault, rather the user's fault or another individuals fault.
 6. Report Bugs
To report bugs, you will need to go to the "issues" tab at https://github.com/CanvasONETech/AVPTag. This is the path to take before taking action against our app, and ensures our bugs will be fixed fast.


We LOVE hearing your ideas! You can give us ideas via. the Issues tab as well!
